## Generations

The Mazda MX-5 has evolved through four distinct generations since its debut in 1989, each maintaining the core philosophy of being a lightweight, rear-wheel-drive roadster while incorporating improvements in power, safety, and technology:

- **First Generation (1989-1997)**: Premiering at the Chicago Auto Show in February 1989, the original MX-5 (NA) went on sale in the United States later that May as a 1990 model. Initially featured a 1.6 L (98 cu in) straight-four engine making 116 horsepower; in late 1993, a larger 1.8-liter engine was made standard in most markets. The MX-5 was designed with inspiration from the Lotus Elan, and features such as pop-up headlights, unique to the NA model, and slim chrome door handles pay homage to the famous British roadster. At launch, the MX-5 Miata is powered by a 116-hp 1.6-liter engine and is available solely with a five-speed manual transmission. Mazda once again ups the MX-5 Miata's horsepower for 1996, this time to 133 ponies.

- **Second Generation (1998-2005)**: After skipping the 1998 model year, the Miata returned in redesigned form for 1999 to kick off its second generation. The NB was a thorough update and reskin of the same basic car, losing the pop-up headlights but keeping the 1.8L engine, now with a new cylinder head and 140 hp. For MY2001, a small facelift was applied to the car that included new triple-lens headlights, and power was further increased to 142 hp through the addition of variable valve timing, while the six-speed manual gearbox became available as an option. For the 2004 model year, a turbocharged 178-hp version of the 1.8L B engine appeared in a new Mazdaspeed MX-5 trim, exclusively with a six-speed manual. Only 5,428 were produced for the US market during the 2004 and 2005 model years.

- **Third Generation (2005-2015)**: Taking design cues from the 2003 Mazda Ibuki concept car, the third-generation Mazda MX-5 was introduced in 2005 and was in production until 2015. This generation introduced Power Retractable Hard Top (PRHT), a variant featuring a folding hard top mechanism that does not encroach on trunk space. For the 2006 model year, Mazda's changes to the MX-5 recipe for its third NC generation were major, ushering in the first brand-new platform, plucked from underneath the rotary RX-8 sports car. It came with a 170-hp 2.0L four-cylinder L Series engine and five- or six-speed manual transmission. The NC generation offered both 1.8-liter (126 hp) and 2.0-liter (158 hp) naturally aspirated engines. For its 2009-2012 model years, the NC Mazda MX-5 received its first facelift with a new smile-style grille and more features, while the engine in the manual cars gained a single horsepower.

- **Fourth Generation (2015-present)**: The fourth-generation Mazda MX-5 was unveiled in 2014 and has been in production since 2015. The fourth-generation MX-5 Miata debuted for 2016 wearing a more aggressive look than its predecessors, with squinty headlights, sharper body angles and a slightly wider and lower stance. Extensive use of aluminum helped the new car shed about 150 pounds compared to the outgoing model. The SkyActiv 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine made 155 horsepower, and a much-improved interior included new safety and technology features. A Targa-style retractable-hardtop version named RF (for Retractable Fastback) was added for 2017. A 2019 refresh brought several internal improvements, including a revamped engine (now with 181 hp), revamped muffler for a snarkier exhaust note and a tilt/telescopic steering column in place of the previous tilt-only unit.
