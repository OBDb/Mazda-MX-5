generations:
  - name: "First Generation (NA)"
    start_year: 1989
    end_year: 1997
    description: "The original Mazda MX-5, also known as the Miata in North America and Eunos Roadster in Japan, revived the classic European sports car formula with a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, lightweight construction, and pure driving focus. The design featured retractable headlights, a compact footprint, and classic roadster proportions. Initially powered by a 1.6L four-cylinder engine producing 116 horsepower (increased to a 1.8L with 128-133 horsepower in later years), paired with a precise five-speed manual transmission or optional four-speed automatic. The simple fabric top could be lowered or raised manually in seconds with one hand. The minimalist interior focused on the driving experience with well-placed controls, supportive seats, and an ergonomic driving position. Special editions included the limited-production BBR Turbo, M Edition models with unique colors and equipment, and the track-focused R Package. The first-generation established the MX-5's reputation for exceptional handling, reliability, and pure driving enjoyment at an accessible price point, winning numerous awards and developing a devoted following among driving enthusiasts. With approximately 400,000 units sold, it became the bestselling two-seat sports car in history."

  - name: "Second Generation (NB)"
    start_year: 1998
    end_year: 2005
    description: "The second-generation MX-5 evolved the successful formula with more modern styling, replacing the retractable headlights with fixed units to meet pedestrian safety regulations, while maintaining similar dimensions and philosophy to its predecessor. Powered by improved 1.8L engines producing 138-146 horsepower depending on market and model year, with five-speed or six-speed manual transmissions or optional four-speed automatic. The structure was significantly stiffer than the original, improving handling precision and safety. Interior improvements included better ergonomics, more supportive seats, and added passenger space despite the similar exterior dimensions. Notable variants included the 10th Anniversary Edition with six-speed transmission, Bilstein suspension, and unique blue color scheme; the high-performance Mazdaspeed/MX-5 SP featuring a factory turbocharger boosting output to 178 horsepower; and in some markets, the unique hardtop coupe NB8C Type S with a fixed roof structure. This generation maintained the original's focus on lightweight, balanced handling while addressing criticisms regarding refinement, safety, and power, further cementing the MX-5's position as the definitive modern roadster."

    end_year: 2015
    description: "The third-generation MX-5 represented the most significant redesign to date, growing slightly in dimensions and weight but maintaining the model's focus on driving enjoyment. The styling became more angular with flared fenders and a more aggressive stance. Powered by a new 2.0L engine producing 170 horsepower (later reduced to 167 due to emissions equipment), paired with improved five-speed and six-speed manual transmissions or an optional six-speed automatic. The chassis was significantly stiffer than its predecessor, with double wishbone front and multi-link rear suspension providing more sophisticated handling characteristics. For the first time, a power retractable hardtop variant (PRHT) was offered alongside the traditional soft top, providing enhanced security and refinement with minimal weight penalty. Interior quality improved substantially with better materials, modern amenities, and improved noise isolation. Special editions included the track-focused Club Sport, luxurious Special Edition models with unique colors and equipment, and the 25th Anniversary Edition featuring exclusive design elements and premium equipment. Despite growing in size and sophistication, this generation maintained the MX-5's characteristic balanced handling and driver engagement while offering more power and refinement than its predecessors."

    end_year: null
    description: "The current MX-5 returned to its roots with a focus on reduced weight and compact dimensions, shedding nearly 220 pounds compared to its predecessor while maintaining modern safety and equipment. The exterior features sharp, contemporary styling with a lower hood line, aggressive headlights, and more sculpted body lines. Initially powered by a 2.0L SkyActiv-G engine producing 155 horsepower (upgraded to 181 horsepower in 2019), paired with either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. For the first time, a retractable fastback (RF) model was introduced, featuring a power-folding hardtop that maintains the coupe-like silhouette even when open. The interior offers modern technology including available Mazda Connect infotainment with a 7-inch touchscreen and rotary controller, while maintaining the driver-focused layout and excellent ergonomics that define the model. Driver assistance features include available blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and lane departure warning, making this the most technologically advanced MX-5 while preserving its pure sports car character. Special editions include the 30th Anniversary model with exclusive Racing Orange paint and unique wheels, and various regional special editions with distinctive appearance packages. The fourth-generation successfully modernizes the MX-5 formula with improved efficiency, technology, and safety while recapturing the lightweight, nimble essence that made the original a driving enthusiast favorite."
